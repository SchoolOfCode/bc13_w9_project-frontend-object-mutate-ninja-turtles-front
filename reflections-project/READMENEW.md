# Reflections-app

This app is designed to enhance the remote experience of a boot camper. We have specifically focused our app on the weekly reflections that boot campers are expected to submit.

This is a simple 3 page app with a landing page, a self assessment tool and a summary.

The app currently only supports one user input.

//Homepage: User is reads assessment tool instructions.

//Self assessment tool: User inputs topics and adds them to their learning list and provides a score bewteen 1 and 10 based on their current ability on that topic.

//Summary: User is provided with a summary of current and previous self assessed scores.
