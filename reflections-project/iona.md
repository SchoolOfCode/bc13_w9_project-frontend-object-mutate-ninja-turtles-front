# Reflections-app

This app is designed to enhance the remote experience of a bootcamper. We have specifically focused our app on the weekly reflections that bootcampers are expected to submit.

This is a simple 3 page app with a landing page, a self assessment tool and a summary.

### Homepage 
User reads instructions.

### Self assessment tool

User inputs topics to be added to their list and provides a score between 1 and 10 based on how they feel they are doing in each topic.

### Summary
User is provided with a summary of current and previous self assessed scores.

## Limitations / Future Features

### Saving multiple scores to the database
The app currently only supports one user input to be saved at a time. In future we aim for the full array of inputs to be saved in one fetch (POST) request.

### Gamification on the Summary Page
Users earn badges based on the frequency of their reflections, whether they submitted them on time and the progress they've made (calculated using their own scores and how they change over time)
